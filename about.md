### Blake Han

I'm a sophomore at NYU College of Arts and Sciences studying computer science and math  
I'm familiar with Java, Python, C, and Javascript.

> This blog site is for my open source class, and I'm looking forward to be able to share my experience and maybe help out others at the meantime!!

Here is a link to [my **github page**](https://github.com/BlakeHan01)
