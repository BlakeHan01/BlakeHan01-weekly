### Blake Han

I'm a junior at NYU College of Arts and Sciences studying computer science and math.  
My interests lie in full-stack development, and as a student, I'm exploring more fields such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'm also expanding my knowledge of full-stack development by applying what I learned to projects, research papers, and tutoring.


In summer 2022, I worked at Econage as a full-stack development intern, and I'm applying for winter, spring, and fall 2023 internships.
